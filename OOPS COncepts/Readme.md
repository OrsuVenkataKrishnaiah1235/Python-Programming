#OOPS CONCEPTS

Oops (Object-Oriented Programming) is a popular programming paradigm that involves representing real-world objects as software objects, with the ability to define properties (attributes) and actions (methods). Python is an object-oriented programming language, and it provides a variety of features to support object-oriented programming.

##Classes and Objects
Classes are templates that define the properties and methods of an object. Objects are instances of a class that are created when the class is instantiated.
